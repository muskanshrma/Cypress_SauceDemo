# Cypress_SauceDemo

Cypress is a test automation tool that works on Javascript and is used to automate unit, integration and end to end tests.
It can also be used to automate API tests.
It has inbuilt waits and features for Screenshot capturing and video recording.

When starting a new project we need to run these npm installation commands:

npm init -y
npm install cypress@9.7.0
npx cypress open or npx cypress run
For implementing Allure reports we have Allure reports commands:

npm i -D @shelex/cypress-allure-plugin
npm install mocha-allure-reporter
npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev
